<h3>Overview of Sever Side Code: </h3>

<p>
  Used the node.js, express.js and mongodb as database to develop the backend for this application
</p>
<p>
  For Authentication, I have created a model schema using the ODM : mongoose and then created the controller for signup and login logic <br/>
  I have used the concept of bcypt, jwt tokens, hashing and cookies for creating the logic for signup and login
</p>
<p>Using the dataset provided by your team, I have used the file system module and path module to fetch the data from that file and create a API for frontend</p>
<p>Used the cors to prevent the cors error and also used the express Router to create routex</p>
